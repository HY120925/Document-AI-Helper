One day a young man named Joseph Weil visited his office, wanting to buy
an apartment he had up for sale. Geezil explained the terms: The price was
$8,000, but he only required a down payment of $2,000. Weil said he
would sleep on it, but he came back the following day and offered to pay
the full $8,000 in cash, if Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal
Weil was working on came through. Even in semiretirement, a clever busi-
nessman like Geezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up
with so much cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Wei] seemed reluc-
tant to say, and quickly changed the subject, but Geezil was persistent. Fi-
nally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the following
story.
