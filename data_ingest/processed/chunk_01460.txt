tried to defend himself, he would have only dragged himself down. His re-
sponse was masterful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoe-
maker, but this only proved his greatness, since he had risen from the
lowest stratum of society to its very pinnacle. From then on he never men-
tioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter
of his ancestry.
Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and
irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has af-
fected you, or that you are offended——that only shows you have acknowl-
edged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without
affectarion.
