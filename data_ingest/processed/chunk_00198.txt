KEYS TO POWER
If you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with elaborate
lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best deceivers utilize a
bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They
know that extravagant words and gestures immediately raise suspicion. In-
stead, they envelop their marlc in the familiar, the banal, the ha.rmless. In
Yellow Kid Weil’s dealings with Sam Geezil, the familiar was a business
deal. In the Ethiopian case, it was Selassie’s misleading obsequiousness—
exactly what'Balcha. would have expected from a weaker warlord.
