JUDGMENT
Everything is judged its appearance,‘ wlmt is unseen
counts for nothing. Never let yourself get lost in the
crowd, ihen, or buried in oblivicm. Stand out. Be am-
spicuous, at all cast. Make youmzlf a magnet of atten-
tion by appearing larger, more colmful, more mysterious
than the bland and timid masses.
