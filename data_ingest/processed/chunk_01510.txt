This is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they were
not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play: People
who flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are expressing a dis
dain and contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance
of the exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unques-
tioningly follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of
superiority. Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect
for those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their
difference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose
beliefs they challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but’ offensively
nonetheless.
