Make your gestures so large, amus-
ing, and scandalous that the
light stays on you while the
other actors are left in
the shadows.
Authority: Be ostentatious and
be seen. . . . What is not seen is
as though it did not exist. . . . It
was light that first caused all cre-
ation to shine forth. Display fills
up many blanks, covers up defi-
ciencies, and gives everything
a second life, especially when it
is backed by genuine merit.
