later, after many futile attempts at duplicating bills, Loller finally went to
the police with the story of how Count Lustig had conned him with a pair
of dollar bills, some chemicals, and a. worthless mahogany box.
Interpretation
Count Lustlg had an eagle eye for other people’s weaknesses. He saw them
in the smallest gesture. Loller, for instance, overtipped waiters, seemed
nervous in conversation with the concierge, talked loudly about his busi»
ness. His weakness, Lustig knew, was his need for social validation and for
the respect that he thought his wealth had earned him. He was also chroni-
cally insecure. Luslig had come to the hotel to hunt for prey. In Loller he
horned in on the perfect sucker»-—a man hungering for someone to fill his
psychic voids.
