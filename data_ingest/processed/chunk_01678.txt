shine the present. He moved on to India, extending his empire beyond all
known limits. Only his disgruntled and weary soldiers prevented him from
going farther.
Interpretation
Alexander represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the son of
a famous and successful man who manages to surpass the father in glory
and power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The father most
often manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because he begins with
little or nothing. A desperate urge irnpels him to succeed»-he has nothing
to lose by cunning and impetuousness, and has no famous father of his
own to compete against. This kind of man has reason to believe in
himself-—-to believe that his way of doing things is the best, because, after
all, it worked for him.
