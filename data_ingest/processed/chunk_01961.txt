Authority: Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in your charac-
ter. For the envious accuse the most perfect of sinning by having no
sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with excel-
lence—it is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its own
venom—affect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to disarm it
beforehand. You thus wave your red cape before the Horns of Envy,
in order to save your immortality. (Baltasar Gracién, 1601-1658)
REVERSAL
The reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so indirect,
and will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But treading carefully
around them will often only make their envy worse. They sense that you
are being cautious, and it registers as yet another sign of your superiority.
