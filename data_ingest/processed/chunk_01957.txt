To deflect envy, Graciein recommends that the powerful display a
weakness, at minor social indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who
envy you something to feed on, distracting them from your more impor-
tant sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. You may have to play
games with appearances, but in the end you will have what counts: true
power. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing envy by doing
as Cosimo de Medici did by showing his wealth only on the inside of his
house. Apply this wisdom to your own character.
