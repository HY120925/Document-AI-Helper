side of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd angles. The doctor and
his wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect the cure, practiced on the
second floor, which was reached by at stairway, at the end of the hall. As the
line edged closer to the stairs, the sick would hear shouts and cries from
above, and word would spread of, perhaps, a blind gentleman suddenly
able to see.
Once upstairs, the line would fork in two directions, toward a north-
ern room for the doctor, a southern one for his wife, who worked only on
the ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in line, the gen-
tlemen patients would be led before the amazing doctor himself, an cl‘
derly man with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air of nervous energy.
