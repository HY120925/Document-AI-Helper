lease you. Mobilize another army against him, if you can, and try once
more to defeat him.” Sobbing, the king fell to the ground, crawled to Liang
on his hands and knees, and prostrated himself at his feet. “Oh great minis-
ter,” cried Menghuo, “yours is the majesty of Heaven. We men of the south
will never again olier resistance to your rule.” “Do you now yield?” asked
Liang. “I, my sons, and my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Hon0r’s
boundless, lifegiving mercy. How could we not yield?”
Liang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished him on
the throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned north
with his army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came back—he had
no need to: Menghuo had become his most devoted and unshakable ally.
