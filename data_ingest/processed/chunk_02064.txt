430 LAW 43
Im age: Mer cury. The winged messenger,
god of commerce, patron saint of thieves,
gamblers, and all those who deceive through
swiftness. The day Mercury was born he invented
the lyre; by that evening he had stolen the cattle of
Apollo. He would scour the world, assuming
whatever form he desired. Like the liquid metal
named after him, he embodies the elusive,
the ungraspable——the power of formlessness.
Authority: Therefore the consummation of forming an army is to arrive
at formlessness. Victory in war is not repetitious, but adapts its form
endlessly.
. . . A military force has no constant formation, water has no
constant shape: The ability to gain victory by changing and adapting ac
cording to the opponent is called genius. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.c.)
