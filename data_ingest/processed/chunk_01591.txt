their armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were torn to pieces,
forcing them to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they had set out with had
either died or deserted them; they had eaten not only the svsnne but the
hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots and fruit. Realizing that they
could not continue this way, Pizarro decided to risk river travel, and a
barge was built out of rotting wood. But the journey down the treacherous
Napo River proved no easier. Setting up camp on the n‘ver’s edge, Gonzalo
sent scouts ahead on the barge to find Indian settlements with food. He
waited and waited for the scouts to return, only to find out they had de-
cided to desert the expedition and continue down the river on their own.
