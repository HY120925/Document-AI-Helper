luster. The Pisans had no defense against this insidious maneuver, which si-
multaneously fed their love of culture and blunted their desire for battle.
Interpretation
Lorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists had a prac-
tical function as well, of which he was keenly aware. In Florence at the
time, banking was perhaps the least admired way of making money, and
was certainly not a respected source of power. The arts were at the other
pole, the pole of qua.si—religious transcendence. By spending on the arts,
Lorenzo diluted people’s opinions of the ugly source of his wealth, disguis-
ing himself in nobility. There is no better use of strategic generosity than
that of distracting attention from an unsavory reality and wrapping oneself
in the mantle of art or religion.
