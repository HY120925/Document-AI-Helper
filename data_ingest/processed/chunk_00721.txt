OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the late fifteenth century, the strongest city~states in Italy-——Venice, Flo-
rence, Rome, and Milan~—-found themselves constantly squabbling. Hover-
ing above their struggles were the nations of France and Spain, ready to
grab whatever they could from the weakened Italian powers. And trapped
in the middle was the small state of Mantua, ruled by the young Duke
Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. Mantua was strategically located in northern
Italy, and it seemed only a matter of time before one of the powers swal-
lowed it up and it ceased to exist as an independent kingdom.
