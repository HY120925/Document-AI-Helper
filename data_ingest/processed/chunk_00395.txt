speech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. “You were a col-
league of Stalirfs,” the heekler yelled, “why didn’t you stop him then?”
Khrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, “VVho
said that?” No hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds
of tense silence, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, “Now you know
why I didn’t stop him.” Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin
was afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain
death, he had made them feel what it was like to face Stalin———had made
them feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking up, the terror of confronting
the leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no
more argument was necessary.
