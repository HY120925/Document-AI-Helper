doctor’s care.
Over the years, the Mountain Doctor’s fame grew. He was consulted
by the powerful—-—even the writer Goethe made the trek to his village——and
he became the center of a cult of nature in which everything natural was
considered worthy of worship. Schiippach was careful to create effects that
would entertain and inspire his patients. A professor who visited him once
wrote, “One stands or sits in company, one plays cards, sometimes with a
young woman; now a concert is given, now a lunch or supper, and now a
little ballet is presented. With a very happy effect, the freedom of nature is
everywhere united with the pleasures of the beau monde, and if the doctor
is not able to heal any diseases, he can at least cure hypochondria and the
vapors.”
