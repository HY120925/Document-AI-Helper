as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing
options. We “choose” to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our
freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to
choose.
This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems from
the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of amdety. The phrase “un-
limited options” sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would
actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of
choices comforts us.
