healing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth, a roman«
ticism. But the appeal to nature can bring you great power, especially in
complicated and stressful times.
This appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of theater
of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the qualities that lit
the romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor played the part to per-
fection, playing up his homespun wisdom and wit, and staging his cures as
dramatic pieces. He did not make himself one with nature; instead he
molded nature into a cult, an artificial construction, To create a “natural”
effect you actually have to work hard, making nature theatrical and de-
lightfully pagan. Otherwise no one will notice. Nature too must follow
trends and be progressive.
