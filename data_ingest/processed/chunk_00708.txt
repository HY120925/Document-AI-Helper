ing: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation,
the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con~
flicts which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war.
Also, the husband becomes the de facto ruler, and often tries to do away
with his wife the queen, as Darnley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth
learned the lesson well. She had two goals as a ruler: to a‘ ‘old marriage and
to avoid war. She managed to combine these goals by Lnngling the possi-
bility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed
to any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She
had to emanate mystery and desirability, never discouraging anyone’s
hopes but never yielding.
