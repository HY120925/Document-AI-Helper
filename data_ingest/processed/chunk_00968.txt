Arsinoe and had her sent to Rome as a prisoner. He also executed the nu»
merous enemies who had conspired against Cleopatra, and imprisoned
others who had opposed her. To reinforce her position as uncontested
queen, Cleopatra now married the only sibling left, Ptolemy XIV—only
eleven at the time, and the weakest of the lot. Four years later Ptolemy
mysteriously died, of poison.
In 41 B.C., Cleopatra employed on a second Roman leader, Marc
Antony, the same tactics she had used so well on Julius Caesar. After se-
ducing him, she hinted to him that her sister Arsinoe, still a prisoner in
Rome, had conspired to destroy him. Marc Antony believed her and
promptly had Arsinoe executed, thereby getting rid of the last of the sib
lings who had posed such a threat to Cleopatra.
