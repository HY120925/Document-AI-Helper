Image: The Hunter, He does not lay the
same trap for a wolf as for a fox. He does
not set bait where no one will take it.
He knows his prey thoroughly, its habits
and hideaways, and hunts accordingly.
Authority: Be Convinced, that there are no
persons so insignificant and inconsiderable,
but may, some time or other, have it in their
power to be of use to you; which they cer-
tainly will not, ifyou have once shown them
contempt. Wrongs are often forgiven, but
contempt never is. Our pride remembers
it for ever. (Lord Chesterfield, 1694-1773)
REVERSAL
What possible good can come from ignorance about other people? Leam
to tell the lions from the lambs or pay the price. Obey this law to its fullest
extent; it has no reversal—-do not bother looking for one.
