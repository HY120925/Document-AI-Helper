creating interest meant creating a crowd; as he later wrote, “Every crowd
has a silver lining.” And crowds tend to act in conjunction. If one person
stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street, more will do the
same. They will gather like dust bunnies. Then, given a gentle push, they
will enter your museum or watch your show. To create a crowd you have to
do something different and odd. Any kind of curiosity will serve the pur-
pose, for crowds are magnetically attracted by the unusual and inexplica-
ble. And once you have their attention, never let it go. If it veers toward
other people, it does so at your expense. Barnum would ruthlessly suck at~
tention from his competitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it is.
