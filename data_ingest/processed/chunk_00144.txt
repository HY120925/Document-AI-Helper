Finally, the problem about working with friends is that it confuses the
boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the
arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em-
ployed to great effect. You must never let your guard down in such a ven-
ture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional
disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of
power, and even the closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of
enernies.
