against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while
secretly gathering information.
The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners
of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in pa-
lite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, “Wit
and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his
thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words
that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he
inject his own personality.” The key here is Talleyrand’s ability to suppress
himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves
and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans.
