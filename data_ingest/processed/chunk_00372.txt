timidate ancl control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de-
moralizing. You must choose your tactics depending on the situation. If
you have time on your side, and know that you and your enemies are at
least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to
you. If time is against you—-your enemies are weaker, and waiting will only
give them the chance to recover—-give them no such chance. Strike quickly
and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, “He can run,
but he can’t hide.”
