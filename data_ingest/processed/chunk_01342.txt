cenainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im
per-ial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis—Phi1ippe
fled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected
Napoleon’s grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unknown, but they
hoped he would recreate the great general’s powerful aura, erasing the
awkward memory of the “bourgeois king.”
Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying
to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically
the same. But the people whom this false gesture is intended to impress will
quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more
power——that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person’s fate.
