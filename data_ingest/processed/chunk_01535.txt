The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all
things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own
ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the
group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game successfully
for yearsmthere were people who vaguely understood what he was up to,
but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will swallow the bait be-
cause it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not
take you as a hypocrite if you are careful~——for how can they accuse you of
hypocrisy if you do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will
they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values~——the values
you share with them, while in their company.
