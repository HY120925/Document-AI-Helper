treated her difl’erently: the dealer Joseph Duveen.
For the first few years of Duveen’s relationship with Arabella, he made
no eifort to sell expensive art to her. Instead he accompanied her to fine
stores, chatted endlessly about queens and princesses he knew, on and on.
At last, she thought, a man who treated her as an equal, even a superior, in
high society. Meanwhile, if Duveen did not try to sell art to her, he did sub-
tly educate her in his aesthetic ideas——n-amely, that the best at was the
most expensive art. And after Arabella had soaked up his way of seeing
things, Duveen would act as if she always had exquisite taste, even though
before she met him her aesthetics had been abysmal.
When Collis Huntington died, in 1900, Arabella came into a fortune.
