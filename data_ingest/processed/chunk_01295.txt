change overnight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his afv
fection would never change.
Once Richelieu had the position he desiredm-prime minister———he dis-
carded the queen mother, moving on to the next weak link in the chain:
the king‘s own character. There was a part of him that would always be a.
helpless child in need of higher authority. It was on the foundation of the
king’s weakness that Richelieu established his own power and fame.
Remember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The person
in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes-«
the favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may
have more weaknesses than the king himself, because his power depends
on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control.
