any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you.
When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to
adapt, attuning yourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that
a group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep your
bags packed.
For this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one.
Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting
them in a group—it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimida-
tion. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may
prove easier to escape than a crowd.
