traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re—create them-
selves. The father must. not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every
step of the way.
Image: The Father. He casts a
giant shadow over his children,
keeping them in thrall long
after he is gone by tying them
to the past, squashing their
youthful spirit, and forcing
them down the same tired path
he followed himself. His tricks
are many. At every cross-
roads you must slay the father
and step out of his shadow.
