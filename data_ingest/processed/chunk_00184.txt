the boxing match and the sale of the lodge.
The fight took place in a gym the next day. Well handled the cash,
which was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was pro»
ceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking glum at
how badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming about the easy
money he was about to make. Then, suddenly, a wild swing by the li-
nai1cier’s fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking him down. When he
hit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He coughed, then lay still.
