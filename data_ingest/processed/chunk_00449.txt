Necessity rules the world. People rarely act unless compelled to. If you
create no need for yourself, then you will be done away with at first oppor-
tunity. If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of Power and make
others depend on you for their welfare, if you can counteract their weak»
ness with your own “iron and blood,” in Bisrn-arck’s phrase, then you will
survive your masters as Bismarck did, You will have all the benefits of
power without the thorns that come from being a master.
Thus a wise prince will think ofways to keep his citizens of every sort
and under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him;
and than they will always be trustworthy.
