Never Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger who
brings bad news: This is a cliche but there is truth to it. You must struggle
and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad
news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good news and your
approach will gladden your master.
