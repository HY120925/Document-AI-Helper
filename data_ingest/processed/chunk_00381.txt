are never neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns the intel
ligence of one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the per-
son he is dealing with. Since each man believes that he is right, and words
will rarely convince him otherwise, the arguer’s reasoning falls on deaf
ears. When cornered, he only argues more, digging his own grave. Once
he has made the other person feel insecure and inferior in his beliefs, the
eloquence of Socrates could not save the situation.
It is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those who
stand above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of opinions
and reasoning. You must be careful, then: Learn to demonstrate the cor-
rectness of your ideas indirectly.
