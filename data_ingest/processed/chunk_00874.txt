everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of
Wales’ patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main
tained his insolent manners, and everyone soon abandoned him. He died
in the most pitiahle poverty, alone and deranged.
Interpretation
Beau Brummell’s devastating wit was one of the qualifies that endeared
him to the Prince of Wales. But not even he, the arbiter of taste and fashion,
could get away with a joke about the prince’s appearance, least of all to his
face. Never joke about a person’s plumpness, even indirectly—and particu*
larly when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with peo-
ple who have made such jokes at their master’s expense.
