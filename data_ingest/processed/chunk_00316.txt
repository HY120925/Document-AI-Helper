In the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attract attention at all
cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never wear the pub-
lic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who
need to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must
seem measured and under control. Mata Hari went too far with her fabri-
cations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it
was a reasonable presumption because all her lies made her seem suspi-
cious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed
into a reputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem a game,
playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and pull back.
