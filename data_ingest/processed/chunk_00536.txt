Authority: Now, the reason a brilliant sovereign and a wise general
conquer the enemy whenever they move, and their achievements
surpass those of ordinary men, is their foreknowledge of the enemy
situation. This “foreknowledge” cannot be elicited from spirits, nor
from gods, nor by analogy with past events, not by astrologic calcu
lations. It must be obtained from men who know the enemy sit-
uati0n—-from spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art if War, fourth century B.C.)
