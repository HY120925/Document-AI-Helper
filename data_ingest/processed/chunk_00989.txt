Daizen’s house to thank him for his clever support
Interpretation
Kuriyama Daizen understood that the granting of a favor is never simple:
If it is done withfuss and obviousness, its receiver feels burdened by an
obligation. This may give the door a certain power, but it is a power that
will eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up resentment and resistance. A
favor done indirectly and elegantly has ten times more power. Daizen
knew a direct approach would only have offended Soemon. By letting his
friend give him the painting, however, he made Soemon feel that he too
had pleased his friend with a gift. In the end, all three parties emerged from
the encounter feeling fulfilled in their own way.
