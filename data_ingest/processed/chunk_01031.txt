one and all that the archangel Michael had appeared to him and an-
nounced that he had been chosen to be the mpitano generale of the Army
of the New Pope, an army that would seize and revitalize the world.
The archangel had further revealed that Born‘ now had the power to see
people’s souls, and that he would soon discover the phi1osopher’s stone-a
longsought--after substance that could change base metals into gold.
Friends and acquaintances who heard Borri explain the vision, and who
witnessed the change that had come over him, were impressed, for Born‘
had previously devoted himself to a life of wine, women, and gambling.
Now he gave all that up, plunging himself into the study of alchemy and
talking only of mysticism and the occult.
