cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.
Image: An Oak
Tree. The oak
that resists the
wind loses its
branches one
by one, and
with nothing
left to protect
it, the trunk fi-
nally snaps.
The oak that
bends lives long-
er, its trunk grow-
ing wider, its roots
deeper and more tenacious.
Authority: Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but
whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,
let them have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to
go a mile, go with him twain. (Jesus Christ, in Matthew 5:38-41)
