might let them hang themselves. Let them be the agents of their own de-
struction. The result will be the same, and you won‘t feel half as bad.
Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much
that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles
had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that in the long run
it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency
involves another n'sk—it may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a
"
grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is almost always wiser to
crush your enemy. If they plot revenge years later, do not let your guard
down, but simply crush them again.
