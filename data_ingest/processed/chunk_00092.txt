that “the bright stars [the moons ofjupiterl offered themselves in the heav~
ens” to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II’s enthronement. He
said that the number of the moons-—-four——harmonized with the number of
the Medicis (Cosimo II had three brothers) and that the moons orbitecl
Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty’s founder.
More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected
the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to
the Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representing Jupiter sitting
on a cloud with the four stars circling about him, and presented this to
Cosimo II as a symbol of his link to the stars.
