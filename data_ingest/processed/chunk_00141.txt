Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you—you are far
better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your
real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to
enhance his reputation as a surefoobed fighter who can be relied upon in
times of uncertainty.
