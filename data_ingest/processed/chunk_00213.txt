LAW
ALWAYS SAY LESS
THAN NECESSARY
_j UDGMENT
When you are trying to impress people with words, the
more you say, the move common you appear and the less
in control. Even you are saying something banal, it will
seem miginal you make it vague, open—ended, and
sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate by
\
saying less. The more you say, the more likely you me to
say somethingfoolish.
