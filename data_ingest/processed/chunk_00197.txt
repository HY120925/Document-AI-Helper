top billing there, making him feel in contro1—-created a thick smoke screen,
concealing the real action three miles away.
Remember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive.
Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their
View in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating
blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other
persorfs supen‘ority——these are perfect diversionary devices.
Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It en-
abled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single
bullet.
Do not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creefis
like a mouse but he has jaws like a lion.
