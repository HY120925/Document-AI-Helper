create enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who will re~
main your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you inflicted on
them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. just recog»
nize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as
you stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as
certainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just
silly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late.
Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure.
Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao:
Never go halfway.
It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment.
