Several days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a Mon-
sieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and that to secure the
sale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two days, bearing a cer-
tified check for more than 250,000 francs (the equivalent today of about
$1,000,000)--—a quarter of the total price. On delivery of the check, he
would receive the documents confirming his ownership of the Eiffel Tower.
Monsieur P. was excited—-he would go down in history as the man who
had bought and torn down the infamous landmark. But by the time he ar-
rived at the suite, check in hand, he was beginning to have doubts about
the whole affair. Why meet in a hotel instead of a government building?
