strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the larger pic-
ture, but you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the
more isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of your isolation when
you choose to——it sinks you deep into its quicksand without your noticing.
If you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and
only in small doses. Be careful to keep your way back into society open.
