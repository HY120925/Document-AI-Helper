Everything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton’s relation»
ship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still lived together, but as Orton
grew successful, Halliwell began to deteriorate. Watching his lover become
the center of attention, he suffered the humiliation of becoming a kind of
personal assistant to the playwright, his role in what had once been a col-
laboration growing smaller and smaller. In the l950s he had supported
Orton with his inheritance; now Orton supported him. At a party or
among friends, people would naturally gravitate towards Orton-—he was
charming, and his mood was almost always buoyant Unlike the handsome
Orton, Halliwell was bald and awkward; his defensiveness made people
want to avoid him.
