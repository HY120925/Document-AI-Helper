cause needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem inter-
ested in other people‘s problems, even sometimes appear to take their side.
But while you make outward gestures of support, you must maintain your
inner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions disengaged. No matter
how hard people try to pull you in, never let your interest in their affairs
and petty squabbles go beyond the surface. Give them gifts, listen with a
sympathetic look, even occasionally play the charmer-—but inwardly keep
both the friendly kings and the perfidious Borgias at arm’s length. By refus~
ing to commit and thus maintaining your autonomy you retain the initia-
tive: Your moves stay matters of your own choosing, not defensive
reactions to the push-and~pu1l of those around you.
