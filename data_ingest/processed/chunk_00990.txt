In essence, Daizen made himself the cat’s-paw, the tool to take the
chestnuts out of the fire. He must have felt some pain in losing the vase, but
he gained not only the painting but, more important, the power of the
courtier. The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any blows against him,
disguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more elegant and clean. By
helping others, the courtier eventually helps himself. Daizen’s example
provides the paradigm for every favor done between friends and peers:
never impose your favors. Search out ways to make yourself the cat’s—paw,
indirectly extricating your friends from distress without imposing yourself
or making them feel obligated to you.
