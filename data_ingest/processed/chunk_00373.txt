WIN THROUGH YOUR
ACTIONS, NEVER
THROUGH ARGUMENT
JUDGMENT
Any momentary triumph you think you have gained
through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The 'resmt~
ment and ill will yau stir up is stronger and lasts longer
than any momentum‘ change ofopiuion. It is much more
powerful to get others to agree with you through your
actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do not
explicate.
