the reality proved immensely disappointing to those who wanted to be
lieve in their hero. The more Coriolanus said, the less powerful he ap-
peared——-a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot
control himself, and is unworthy of respect.
Had Coriolanus said less, the people would never have had cause to
be offended by him, would never have known his true feelings. He would
have maintained his powerful aura, would certainly have been elected con’
sul, and would have been able to accomplish his antidemocratic goals. But
the human tongue is a beast that few can master. It strains constantly to
break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will run wild and cause you
grief. Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words.
