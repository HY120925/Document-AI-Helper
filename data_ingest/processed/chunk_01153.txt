never let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated goal, he
withdrew into his shell like a turtle. This kind of selfcontrol is godlike.
When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way
to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to
improvise. Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are
the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude their actions success-
fully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation.
lm age:
The Gods on
Mount Olympus.
Looking down on
human actions from the
clouds, they see in advance the
endings of all the great dreams that
lead to disaster and tragedy, And
they laugh at our inability to see beyond
the moment, and at how we delude ourselves.
