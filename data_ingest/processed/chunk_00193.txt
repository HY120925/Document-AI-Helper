lassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be out-
wittecl. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to
call the shots in the days to come.
At the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march
back to camp amidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital
over his shoulder, he planned his strategy—-how his own soldiers would
march through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be
put in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came
in sight of his camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong.
Where before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye
could see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires. What
devil’s magic was this?
