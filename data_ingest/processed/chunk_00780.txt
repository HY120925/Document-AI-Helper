USE THE SURRENDER
TACTIC: TRANSFORM
WEAKNESS INTO POWER
J U D G M E N T
When you are weaker, neverfight for honor’: sake; choose
surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover;
time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait
for his power to wane. Do not give him the satisfaction of
fighting and defeating you——surrenderfirst. By turning
the other cheek you infuriate and unsettle him. Make
surrender a tool ofpower.
