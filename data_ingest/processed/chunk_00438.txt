of all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the employ of the city
of Venice, which was in the midst of a long war with Florence. The count
was suddenly recalled to Venice. A favorite of the people, he was received
there with all kinds of honor and splendor. That evening he was to dine
with the doge himself, in the doge’s palace. On the way into the palace,
however, he noticed that the guard was leading him in a different direction
from usual. Crossing the famous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized
where they were taking him—to the dungeon. He was convicted on a
trurnped~up charge and the next day in the Piazza San Marco, before a
horrified crowd who could not understand how his fate had changed s
drastically, he was beheaded.
