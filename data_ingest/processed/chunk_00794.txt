wore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that
the committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker), answered their
questions politely, and generally deferred to their authority.
Unlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether
he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said,
which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked him, “is it
true you have written a number of revolutionary plays?” Brecht had writ-
ten many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, “I
have written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against
Hitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary
because I, of course, was for the overthrow of that government.” This state
ment went unchallenged.
