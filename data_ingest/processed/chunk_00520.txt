his prey, learning the man’s habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he secretly
put several of Mellon’s staff on his own payroll, worming valuable informa-
tion out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about
as well as Mellon’s wife did.
In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on
the third floor of Claridge’s Hotel. Duveen booked himself into the suite
just below Mellon’s, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to
befriend Mellon’s valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his
move, Mellon’s valet told Duveen’s valet, who told Duveen, that he had
just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was mak-
ing his way down the corridor to ring for the lift.
