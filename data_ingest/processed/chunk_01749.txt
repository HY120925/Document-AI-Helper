have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could
do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it
better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to
risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them close, you can secretly whit-
tle away at their support base, so that when the time comes to cut them
loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.
