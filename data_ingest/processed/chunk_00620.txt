man might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall him and
start treating him well again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder
whether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious,

pected such honor. The duke would rebuke him for his lack of ambition
and would send him away.
The secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to
know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please him. Never inject
your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst
the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal-
lenged and at peace.
