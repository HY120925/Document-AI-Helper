Bavarian citizen. The kings entourage tried to wake him to the dangers of
the affair, but those who criticized Lola were summarily fired.
While Bavarians who had loved their king now outwardly disre—
spected him, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built for herself,
and began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy. She was the
most powerful force in the kingdom. Her influence in the king’s cabinet
continued to grow, and she treated the other ministers with disdain. As a
result, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once peaceful land was vir~
rually in the grip of civil war, and students everywhere were chanting,
“Raus mit Lola!”
By February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the pres-
sure. With great sadness he ordered Lola. to leave Bavaria immediately.
