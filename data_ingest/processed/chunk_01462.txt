REVERSAL
You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small
troubles will vanish on their own if you leave them be; but some will grow
and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of inferior stature and
the next time you look he has become a serious rival, and your contempt
has made him vengeful as well. The geat princes of Renaissance Italy
chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the outset of his career as a young general
in the army of his father, Pope Alexander VI. By the time they paid a1ten~
tion it was too lat.e——the cub was now a lion, gobbling up chunks of Italy.
Often, then, while you show contempt publicly you will also need to keep
an eye on the problem privately, monitoring its status and making sure it
goes away. Do not let it become a cancerous cell.
