sweeter to my ear than the words ‘Why have you come again .9’

KEYS TO POWER
Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong pres-
ence will draw power and attention to you—you shine more brightly than
those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much pres-
ence creates the opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from,
the more your value degrades. You become a habit. No matter how hard
you try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why. people respect
you less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself
before they unconsciously push you away. It is a game of hide—and~seek.
