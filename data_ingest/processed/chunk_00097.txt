superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a. deadly
but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting
your gifts and talents, you are winning the master’s affection. He may feign
appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone
less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced
the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will
not admit the tmth, but will find an excuse to rid himself of your presence.
This Law involves two rules that you must realize, First, you can inad-
vertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are masters
who are more insecure than others, nronstrously insecure; you may natu-
rally outshine them by your charm and grace.
