Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state of Sparta, however,

they turned on the cities around them, and, in a series of brutal, violent
conflicts lasting more than a hundred years, managed to conquer an im-

to their problem, however, brought a new, more formidable one: How

nate peoples they ruled now outmimbered them ten to one. Surely this
horde would take a horrible revenge on them.
