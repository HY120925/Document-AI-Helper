1.516 LAW 24
Scene VI
Pope Urban VIII wanted to be remembered for his skills in writing poetry,
which unfortunately were mediocre at best. In 1629 Duke Francesco
d’Este, knowing the pope’s literary pretensions, sent the poet Fulvio Testi
as his ambassador to the Vatican. One of Tes|i’s letters to the duke reveals
why he was chosen: “Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart,
but His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he
sleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed at bundle of papers and
thus, turning to me with a smiling face, he said: ‘We want Your Lordship to
listen to some of our compositions.’ And, in fact, he read me two very long
Pindaric poems, one in praise of the most hoiy Virgin, and the other one
about Countess Matilde.”
