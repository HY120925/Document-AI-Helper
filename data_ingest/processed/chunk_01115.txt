than starting off with piecemeal concessions and trying to meet the other

Understand: If boldness is not natural, neither is timidity. It is an ac-
quired habit, picked up out of a. desire to avoid conflict. If timidity has
taken hold of you, then, root it out Your fears of the consequences of a
bold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the conse
quences of timidity are worse. Your value is lowered and you create a self~
fulfilling cycle of doubt and disaster. Remember: The problems created by
an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater
audacity.
