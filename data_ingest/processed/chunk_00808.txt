Power is always in flux—since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena
of constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even-
tually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened,
the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourselfup again»-it disguises your
ambition; it teaches you patience and self—control, key skills in the game;
and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage of your up-
pressofs sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you
cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.
