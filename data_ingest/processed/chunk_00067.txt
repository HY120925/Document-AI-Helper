myths, in India’s Mahabharata cycle, in the Middle Eastern epic of Gilga~
mesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man,
Odysseus for instance, was judged by his ability to rival the craftiness of the
gods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and de-
ception. Deception is a developed art of civilization and the most potent
weapon in the game of power.
