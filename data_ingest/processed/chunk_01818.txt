it up so that it would appear as if Fouché were a loyal double agent too.
Fouché gained power and flourished in a period of great tumult by
mirroring those around him. Duning the French Revolution he was a radi-
cal jacobin; after the Terror he became a moderate republican; and under
Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Napoleon ennobled
and made the duke of Otranto. If Napoleon took up the weapon of digging
up dirt on people, Fouché made sure he had the dirt on Napoleon, as well
as on everyone else. This also allowed him to predict the emperor’s plans
and desires, so that he could echo his boss’s sentiments before he had even
uttered them. Shielding his actions with a mirror strategy, Fouché could
also plot offensive moves without being caught in the act.
