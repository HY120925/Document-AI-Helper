the degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of deferring to
others, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo de’ Medici per-
fected this game; he was a consummate con artist of appearances. No one
could gauge the extent of his power———his modest exterior hid the truth.
Never be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by
flaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By making others aware
of their inferior position, you are only stirring up “unhappy admiration,” or
envy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you
cannot foresee. The fool dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories.
The master of power understands that the appearance of superiority over
others is inconsequential next to the reality of it.
