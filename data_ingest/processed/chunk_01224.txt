ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa»
tients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent susceptibility
to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old
habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see him. To avoid this, Ericlo
son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel
as bad as when they first came in—-——to go back to square one. Faced with
this option, the patients would usually “choose” to avoid the relapse-
which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted.
This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people
who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to
“choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.
