word “F-R-A-U-D. ”Kleppini never figured out how Houdini had accom-
plished this uncanny feat.
Interpretation
Although we do not know for certain how Houdini accomplished many of
his most ingenious escapes, one thing is clear: It was not the occult, or any
kind of magic, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless prac-
tice, all of which he carefully concealed from the world. Houdini never left
anything to chance-—-day and night he studied the workings of locks, re-
searched centuries-old sleight—of-hand tricks, pored over books on mechan
ics, whatever he could use. Every moment not spent researching he spent
working his body, keeping himself exceptionally limher, and learning how
to control his muscles and his breathing.
