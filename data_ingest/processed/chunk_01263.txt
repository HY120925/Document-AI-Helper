The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union ofsouls.
In the 19205 the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of
the agevold Sir Francis Drake swindle—basically promising any sucker who
happened to be surnamed “Drake” a substantial share of the long-lost
“Drake treasure,” to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Mid-
west fell for the scam, which Hartzell cleverly turned into a crusade against
the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake for»
tune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical union
of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings. Promise such
