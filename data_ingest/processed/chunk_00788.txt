gives you nothing to gain but martyrdom, and in the process a lot of people
who do not believe in your cause will die.
Weakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you learn how
to play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place, they would
have been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or might have
gotten what they could have out of the alliance and then left it when the
Athenians themselves were weakened, as in fact happened several years
later. Fortunes change and the mighty are often brought down. Surrender
conceals great power: Lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you
time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge. Never sacrifice that
time in exchange for honor in a battle that you cannot win.
