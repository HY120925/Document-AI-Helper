out, just as you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world
to your advantage. Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything
solid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to
cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise
your enemies—by the time they figure out where you are and what you are
up to, it is too late.
When you want to fight us, we don’t let you and you can ’tfind us. But when
we want tofight you, we make sure that you can ’z get away and we hit you
squarely.
. . and wipe you out. . . . The enemy advances, we retreat; the em.-my
camps, we harms; the enemy tires, we attadc; the enemy retreats, we pursue.
