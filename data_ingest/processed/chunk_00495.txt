which bore no fruit, but
only served as a perch
for (he sparrows‘ and
grasshoppers. He
rc.wlvc'd to our il down,
and, taking his ax in
lmml, made a hold
stmkre at its roots. The
grasslxappzm and spar-
rows emreated him not

that .\‘h€l((‘I’(,'d them, but
to spare it, and they
would sing (0 him and
ltghlen his labors. He
paid no nrrmlzrm I0
their request, bu! gave
the tree Ll second and [1
third blow with his ax.
When he reached I/1e
hollow Uflhe true, he
found a hive full of
honey. Having tasted
the honeym11xb, he
threw down his ax, am},
looking on the tree as
sacred, took great care
