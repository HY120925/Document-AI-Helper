LAW
GET OTHERS TO DO THE
WORK FOR YOU, BUT,
ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT
JUDGMENT
Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people
to further your own cause. Not only will such assistance
save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a
godlike aura of qfficiency and speed. In the end your
helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembeml.
Never do yourself what others can do for you.
