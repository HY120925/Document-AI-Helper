a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded him in the
senate and stabbed him to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of
drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth’s
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing him to die covered and de-
cent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words to his
old friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek,
and as if rehearsed for the end of a play: “You too, my child?”
Interpretation
The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds
unimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience
would be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater
seemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form.
