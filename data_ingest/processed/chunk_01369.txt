of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially
saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that
you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the
Duke of Mantua as his nerd patron, he knew that if he was slavish and
sycophantic, the duke would think him unworthy; so he approached the
duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the wn‘ter’s good friend Titian.
