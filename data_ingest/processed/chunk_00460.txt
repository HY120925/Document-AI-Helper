Harry Cohn was no bleeding—heart liberal; in fact, he had always been
a diehard Republican.
His favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once vis-
ited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he
hated Cohn would call him a “Communist bastard.” But to the executives’
amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not keep the
screenwriter on because he was a good Writer—there were many good
writers in Hollywood. He kept him because of a chain of dependence:
Lawson was Humphrey Bogart’s writer and Bogart was Columbia’s star. If
Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela-
tionship. That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to him
by his defiance of the committee.
