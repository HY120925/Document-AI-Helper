fering with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new strategy in
the patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established himself in Venice,
where few had heard of him. He had a fair amount of money he had man-
aged to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his new home, how-
ever, he flirew open its doors to rich and poor, regaling them with
banquets and amusements. He befriended each and every gondolier, tip-
ping them royally. In the streets, he spread his money liberally, giving it
away to beggars, orphans, Washerwomen. Among the city’s commoners,
word quickly spread that Aretino was more than just a great writer, he was
a man of power—-a kind of lord.
Artists and men of influence soon began to frequent Areu‘no’s house.
