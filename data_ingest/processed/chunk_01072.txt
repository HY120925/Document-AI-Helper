R EVE RSAL
One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive
than an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This
comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through
you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived Soul but an angry crowd
that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The Charlatans
constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as
it inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas
were sham. Too slow and they paid with their lives. In playing with the
crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out for
any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you.
