times play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness
from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of
his own sacrifices for the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you
may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and
trembling in your subordinates. Instead of the ca.t‘s~paw you show your
own mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If
you play it too often, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you
know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday
bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat’s-paw——it is far safer.
