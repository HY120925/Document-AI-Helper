to float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That
kind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will

unable to isolate you from your allies. Always on the move, you mix and
mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No
hunter can fix his aim on such a svvifbmoving creature.
