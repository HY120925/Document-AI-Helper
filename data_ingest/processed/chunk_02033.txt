“Every Chinese,” Mao once wrote, “should consciously throw himself
into this war of a jigsaw pattern” against the Nationalists. Place your men in
ajigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out
what you are up to. Either he wastes time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai‘
shek, he assumes you are incompetent and fails to protect himself. And if
he concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a
sitting duck for encirclement. In the weiwhi way of war, you encircle the
enemy’s brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to
confuse and dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communis(s—an ap-
parent foxmlessness that disoriented and terrified their enemy.
