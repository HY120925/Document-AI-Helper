start a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three miles
from the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come
to him.
Selassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after»
noon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history—he knew
that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a trap.
Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have him arrested or
murdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come
to the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal b0dyguaId—-500 of
his best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend him and themselves. To
Balcha’s surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he
would be honored to play host to such warriors.
