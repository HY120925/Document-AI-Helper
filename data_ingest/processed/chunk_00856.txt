ments, you paradoxically call attention to your own. The ability to express
wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying tal-
ent, but one still greatly valued.
Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you
would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mir-
ror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling
you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: Ybu
must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see yourself as others see
you. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do
you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the
decline? Be observant about yourself and you will avoid a mountain of
blunders.
