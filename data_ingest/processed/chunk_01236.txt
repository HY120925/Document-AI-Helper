you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan
your deceptions. The nineteenth~century banker James Rothschild liked
this method: He felt that if he tried to control his opponents’ movements,
he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective
course. The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more
forcefully he could act against them in the long run.
