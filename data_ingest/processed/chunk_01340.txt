284 LAW 34
On the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the
palace. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis-
Philippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no sue»
cessor, nor even the suggestion of one-—his whole government folded up
and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town.
Interpretation
Louis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that natu.rally pertains to
kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur, he believed a
new world was dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi
zens. He was right: A new world, without kings and queens, was certainly
on its way. He was profoundly wrong, however, in predicting a change in
the dynamics of power.
