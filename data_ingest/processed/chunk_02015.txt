collapsed, never to recover.
Interpretation
In the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always spelled dis-
aster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes a
dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making it
hard for it to forage for food and making it a target for fast~moving preda-
tors. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and that move swiftly and unpre
djctably, are infinitely more powerful and secure.
In facing a serious problem~——controlling superior numbers—Sparta
reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the envi-
ronment. But like a turtle, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They
managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but at what cost?
