Unpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling your pat-
terns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate intet—
est. People will talk about you, ascribe motives and explanations that have
nothing to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly in their minds. In
the end, the more capricious you appear, the more respect you will garner.
Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.
Image: The Cyclone. A
wind that cannot be fore-
seen. Sudden shifts in
the barometer, in—
explicable changes
in direction and
velocity. There is
no defense: A
cyclone sows
terror and
confusion.
Authority: The enlightened ruler is so mysterious that he seems
to dwell nowhere, so inexplicable that no one can seek him.
