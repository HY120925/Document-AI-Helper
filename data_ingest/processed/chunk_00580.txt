to taste that joy, he decided to try one more time: He drove her away with
harsh words and threatening gestures. She left, this time vowing never to
see him again.
The next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He
rode back to javiac, but the lady would not receive him, and ordered her
servants to chase him away, across the drawbridge and over the hill. Guil-
laume fled. Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to cry: He had
made a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see his lady, he ex-
perienced the absence, the terrible absence, that can only inflame love. He
wrote one of his most beautiful poems, “My song ascends for mercy pray-
ing.” And he sent many letters to Guillelma, explaining what he had done,
and begging forgiveness.
