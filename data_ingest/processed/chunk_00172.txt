Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing
some apparent secret. This feigned confidence——a decoy—-would then
elicit a real confidence on the other person’s part.

qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise
their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal
of weapons.
