political policies without his approval or even his knowledge; they also
plotted against him. By the end, he was emperor in name only, and was so
isolated that barely anyone knew he had died. He had probably been poi-
soned by the same scheming ministers who encouraged his isolation.
That is what isolation brings: Retreat into a. fortress and you lose con-
tact with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happen-
ing around you, as well as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you
cut yourself off from the kind of knowledge on which your life depends.
Never enclose yourself so far from the streets that you cannot hear what is
happening around you, including the plots against you.
