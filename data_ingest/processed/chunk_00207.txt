dumb and docile. With a
sheepskin on his back,
a fox can pass right
into the chicken coop.
Authority: Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends to
surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy? Conceal your
purpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your
designs until they cannot be opposed. until the combat is over. Win
the victory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those walk
like people whose designs are not known except by the ravaged coun—
try through which they have passed. (Ninon cle Lenclos, 16234706)
