Never go halfway.
It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment.
Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your ene-
mies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating
themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least un-
derstand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever
friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own
war-iness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then plot for the best
time to act.

beneath your foot but left
alive, will rear up and bite
you with a double dose of
venom. An enemy that is
left around is like a half-
deacl viper that you nurse
back to health. Time makes
the venom grow stronger.
