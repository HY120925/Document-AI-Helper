Authority: Avoid outsliining the master. All superiority is odious, but the
superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it. is fatal. This is a
lesson that the stars in the sky Leach us-—--they may be related to the sun,
and just as brilliant, but they never appear in her company. (Baltasar
Grzutifm, llilll-I658}
REVERSAI.
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you
must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing
to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful-—-your master had no such
scruples in his own cold—blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he
is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outclo, outchann, outsmart him at
key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course.
