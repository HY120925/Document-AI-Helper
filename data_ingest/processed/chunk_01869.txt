Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig II’s grandfather
into a crisis that had forced him to abclicate. Warned that he could be in-
fected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-——-“I am no Lola Montez,"
he said. Soon enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the
favors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed him “the second
Lola,” or “Lolotte.” He unconsciously began to tread in Lo1a’s footsteps-
spending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even
dabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Mean-
while Ludwigs affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a
l-:ing——just like his grandfather’s love for Lola Montez.
