stuck to his guns.
Only a week after becoming prime minister, Bismarck made an im-
promptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the need to
enlarge the army. He ended by saying, “The great questions of the time
will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron
and blood.” His speech was immediately disseminated throughout Ger-
many. The queen screamed at her husband that Bismarck was a barbaric
militar-ist who was out to usurp control of Prussia, and that William had to
fire him. The liberals in the government agreed with her. The outcry was
so vehement that Williarn began to be afraid he would end up on a scaf-
fold, like Louis XVI of France, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister.
