next day Soemon in turn received a package from Daizen. Inside it was a
beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, in an accompanying note, asked
his friend to accept as a token of his appreciation for the painting that Soe~
mon had so graciously given him the day before. He explained that the
vase had been made by Sen no Rikyu himself, and bore an inscription
from Emperor Hideyoshi. If Soemon did not care for the vase, Daizen sug~
gested, he might make a gift of it to an adherent of Cha«no—yu—-perhaps
the merchant Kawachiya Sanemon, who had often expressed a desire to
possess it. “I hear,” Daizen continued, “he has a fine piece of fancy paper
[the 3()()~ryo I.O.U.] which you would much like. It is possible you might
arrange an exchange.”
