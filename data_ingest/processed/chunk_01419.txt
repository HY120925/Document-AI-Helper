Image: The Hawk. Patiently and silently it circles the sky, high
above, allxseeing with its powerful eyes. Those below have
no awareness that they are being tracked. Suddenly,
when the moment arrives, the hawk swoops
down with a speed that cannot be de
fancied against; before its prey
knows what has happened,
the bird‘s viselike talons
have carried it
up into the
sky.
Authority: There is a tide in the affairs of men, / Which, taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune; I’ Omitted, all the voyage of their life / Is bound in
shallows and in miseries. (julius Caesar, William Shakespeare, 1564-1616)
