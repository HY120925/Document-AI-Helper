remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their characters have secret recesses
that they never reveal. The unknowableness of other people could prove
disturbing if we thought about it long enough, since it would make it im-
possible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this fact,
and to judge people on their appearances, on what is most visible to our
eyes—-clothes, gestures, words, actions. In the social realm, appearances are
the barometer of almost all of our judgments, and you must never be nus-
led into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change
in your appearance, can prove disastrous.
