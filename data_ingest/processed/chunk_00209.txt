As P. T. Barnum, the nineteenth-century king of humbuggery, grew
older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one
point he organized a buffalo hunt in New jersey, complete with Indians
and a few imported buffalo. He publicized the hunt as genuine, but it came
off as so completely fake that the crowd, instead of getting angry and ask-
ing for their money back, was greatly amused. They knew Barnum pulled
t:ricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for
it. Learning a lesson from this affair, Barnum stopped concealing all of his
devices, even revealing his deceptions in a tell—all autobiography. As
Kierkegaard wrote, “The world wants to be deceived.”
