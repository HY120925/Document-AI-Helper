In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to con
vert the people ofjapan to Catholicism, while at the same time Portugal
had a monopoly on trade between japan and Europe. Although the mis-
sionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling elite;
by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing had
completely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch
began to arrive in japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He
needed Europeans for their know-how in guns and navigation, and here at
last were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion——the Dutch
wanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portuguese. From
then on, he would only deal with the practicalminded Dutch.
