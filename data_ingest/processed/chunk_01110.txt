so we admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their self-
confidence infects us and draws us outside our own realm of inwardness
and reflection.
Few are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on the
battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In social set
tings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and practiced bold-
ness in every part of his life because he saw its tremendous power, how it
could literally enlarge it man (even one who, like Napoleon, was in fact
conspicuously small). We also see this change in Ivan the Terrible: A harm-
less boy suddenly transforms himself into a powerful young man who com-
mands authority, simply by pointing a finger and taking hold action.
