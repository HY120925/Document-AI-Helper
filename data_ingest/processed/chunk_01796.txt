are up to—they are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy for dealing with
you depends on your reacting to them in a way characteristic of you; new
tralize it by playing a game of mimicry with them. The tactic has a mock—
ing, even infuriating effect. Most of us remember the childhood experience
of someone teasing us by repeating our words exactly-—after a while, usu-
ally not long, we wanted to punch them in the face. Working more subtly
as an adult, you can still unsettle your opponents this way; shielding your
own strategy with the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your oppo-
nents into the trap they planned for you.
This powerful technique has been used in military strategy since the
days of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political campaigning.
