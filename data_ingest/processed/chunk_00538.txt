mans consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for
Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of the city, landing in the
less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Ger-
mans relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not
know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place,
English—c0ntrolled agents were feeding them subtly deceptive information.
The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time
they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the
country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent ad
vantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of
your enemy’s eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.
