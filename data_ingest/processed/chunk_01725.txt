get his way. Once in power, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and uni-
fied the Papal States. The European powers began to fear him, and sent
delegates to negotiate with him. The German King Albrecht of Austria
even yielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to
the pope’s plan.
One piece did not fall into place, however, and that was Tuscany, the

powerful city, the region would be his. But Florence was a proud republic,
and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards skillfully.
Florence was divided by two rival factions, the Blacks and the Whites.
