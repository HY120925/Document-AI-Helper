With each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon soared.
Meanwhile. France itself was deteriorating: There was famine and wide
spread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seethed with resent-
ment-—the queen treated them like children. Only her favorites mattered,
and these were becoming fewer and fewer. But Marie~Antoinette did not
concern herself with this. Not once throughout her reign did she read a
minister’s report. Not once did she tour the provinces and rally the people
to her side. Not once did she mingle among the Parisians, or receive a dc}
egation from them. She did none of these things because as queen she felt
the people owed her their affection, and she was not required to love them
in return.
