horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy.” By
the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari
dance, her name was on everyone’s lips.
As Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept
changing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter
of ajavanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she
had spent her time “horsebaxzk riding, gun in hand, and risking her life.”
No one knew certain about her, but journalists did not mind these
changes in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a
creature from the pages of Baudelaire—whatever their imagination wanted
to see in this mysterious woman from the East.
In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public.
