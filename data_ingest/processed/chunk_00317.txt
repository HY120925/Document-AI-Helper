playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and pull back.
There are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and
when scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The at-
tention you attract must never offend or challenge the reputation of those
above you—not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal-
try but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing when to draw
notice and when to withdraw.
Lola Montez was one of the great practitioners of the art of attracting
attention. She managed to rise from a middle—class Irish background to
being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of
King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of
proportion.
