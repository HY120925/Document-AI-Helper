In exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he
would tell suckers about a fixed horse race, or a stock that would earn 200
percent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker’s

The lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of easy
money. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their lap
rather than to work for it. For at small sum, sell them advice on how to
make millions (P. T. Barnum did this later in life), and that small sum will
become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers. Lure people in
with the prospect of easy money and you have the room to work still more
deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough to blind your victims
