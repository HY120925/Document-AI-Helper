clothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks-—

and when you reflect it back to him his pleasure is heightened because it is
unasked for. Remember: The wordless communication, the indirect com~
pliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the
Courtier’s Mirror.
