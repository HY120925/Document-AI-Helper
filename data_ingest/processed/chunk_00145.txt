CONCEAL YOUR
INTENTIONS
JUD G M E NT
Keep people ojfbalancc and in the dark by never reveal-
ing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue
what you are up to, they cannot prepmzz cl defense. Guide
them far enough down the wrong path, mzrelop them in
enough smoke, and by the time they realize your inten-
tions, it will be too late.
