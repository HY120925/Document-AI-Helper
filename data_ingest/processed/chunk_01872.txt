JUDGMENT
Everyone understands the need for change in the air
stract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of
habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will head
to revolt. Ifyou an: new to a position ofpower, or an out-
side?" trying to build a power base, make a show of re-
specting the old way of doing things. If change it
necessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the
past.
