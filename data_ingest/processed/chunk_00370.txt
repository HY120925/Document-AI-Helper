Authority: Good warriors make others
come to them, and do not go to others. This
is the principle of emptiness and fullness
of others and self. When you induce oppo-
nents to come to you, then their force is
always empty; as long as you do not
go to them. your force is always full. Attack
ing emptiness with fullness is like throwing
stones on eggs. (Zhang Yu. eleventh
century commentator on The Art 0/’ W11}
