stones (one color for each side) are placed on the board’s intersections, one
at a time, wherever you like. Once all your stories (52 for each side) are on
the board, the object is to isolate the stones of your opponent by encircling
them.
A game of go——called wet’-chi in China-can last up to three hundred
moves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly;
the more complex the pattern your stories initially create on the board, the
harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to con-
trol a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger
terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate
the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility.
