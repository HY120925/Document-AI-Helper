For all these reasons, he said, the great prince should pardon the Poggios
and listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do,
since the family had willingly laid down their arms and had always sup-
ported him.
Castmccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or
resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail,
and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their
grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another,
Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show
his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to
the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days
later all were executed, including Stefano.
