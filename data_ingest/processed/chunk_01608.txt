Artists and men of influence soon began to frequent Areu‘no’s house.
Within a few years he made himself a celebrity; no visiting dignitary would
think of leaving Venice without paying him a call. His generosity had cost
him most of his savings, but had bought him influence and a good name—
a cornerstone in the foundation of power. Since in Renaissance Italy as
elsewhere the ability to spend freely was the privilege of the rich, the arisv
tocracy thought Aretino had to be a man of influence, since he spent
money like one. And since the influence of a man of influence is worth
buying, Aretino became the recipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys.
Dukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, and popes and princes com-
peted to gain his favor, and showered him with all kinds of presents.
