equally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only solution for Bel»
boa was to seize the initiative by proposing to cross the jungle with a
larger army, carrying shipbuilding materials and tools. Once on the Pa—
cific coast, he would create an armada. with which to conquer the Incas.
Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the plan—--perhaps sensing it
would never work. Hundreds died in this second march through the jun-
gle, and the timber they carried rotted in the torrential rains. Balboa, as
usual, was undaunted»-no power in the world could thwart his plan—and
on arriving at the Pacific he began to cut down trees for new lumber. But
the men remaining to him were too few and too weak to mount an inva-
sion, and once again Balboa had to return to Darien.
