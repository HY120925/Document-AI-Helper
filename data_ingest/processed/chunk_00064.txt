doorways, you must be able to look in both directions at once, the better to
handle danger from wherever it comes. Such is the face you must create for
yourself-one face looking continuously to the future and the other to the
ast.P
For the future, the motto is, “No days unalert.” Nothing should catch
you by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before
they arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of your plan’s happy
ending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pit-
fall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you
plan, the more powerful you become.
The other face ofJanus looks constantly to the past—though not to re-
member past hurts or bear grudges. That would only curb your power.
