somehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in
private. Many of these so-called Marranos (originally a derogatory term,
being the Spanish for “pig”) attained high levels of government office, mar-
ried into the nobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only
to be discovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition
was specifically commissioned to ferret them out.) Over the years they
mastered the art of dissimulation, displaying cmcifixes liberally, giving
generous gifts to churches, even occasionally making anti-Semitic
rema.rks—~and all the while maintaining their inner freedom and beliefs.
In society, the Man-anos knew, outward appearances are what matter.
