emotion of envy. First, accept the fact that there will be people who will
surpass you in some way, and also the fact that you may envy them. But
make that feeling a way of pushing yourself to equal or surpass them some-
day. let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul; expel it outward and it
can move you to greater heights.
Second, understand that as you gain power, those below you will feel
envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevitable. Do not naively ac-
cept the facade they show you———read between the lines of their criticisms,
their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the excessive praise
that is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in the eye. Half the prob-
lem with envy comes when we do not recognize it until it is too late.
