held his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid
Napoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man’s weakness, his
impetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played

able to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of his success would have
been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting
the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands.
