they laugh at our inability to see beyond
the moment, and at how we delude ourselves.
Authority: How much easier it is never to get in than to get yourself
out! We should act contrary to the reed which, when it first appears,
throws up a long straight stem but afterwards, as though it were ex-
hausted . . . makes several dense knots, indicating that it no longer
has its original vigor and drive. We must rather begin gently and
coolly, saving our breath for the encounter and our vigorous thrusts
for finishing off the job. In their beginnings it is we who guide affairs
and hold them in our power; but so often once they are set in motion,
it is they which guide us and sweep us along. (Montaigne. 1533-1592)
