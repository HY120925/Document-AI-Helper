Image: The Innocent Goat. On
the Day of Atonement, the high
priest brings the goat into the
temple, places his hands on its
head, and confesses the pea»
ple’s sins, transferring guilt to
the guiltless beast, which is
then led to the wilderness and
abandoned, the people’s sins
and blame vanishing with him.
Authority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being
incapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise
conceal the blunders they have made, while fools make them pub~
lic. Reputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is
seen. If you can’t be good, be careful. (Baltasar Grecian, 16014658)
