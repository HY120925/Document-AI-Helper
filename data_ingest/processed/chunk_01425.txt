would be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the latest in
weaponry, communicated by radio, and were supported by reconnais-
sance from the air.
In the first few months, the troops split up into small units to comb the
wilds of northern Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000 rewmd for in-
fonnation leading to Villa’s capture. But the Mexican people, who had
been disillusioned with Villa when he had returned to banditry, now idol-
ized him for facing this mighty American army. They began to give Persh-
ing false leads: Villa had been seen in this village, or in that mountain
hideaway, airplanes would be dispatched, troops would scurry after them,
and no one would ever see him. The wily bandit seemed to be always one
step ahead of the American military.
