If you keep your growing number of suitors waiting too long, you will in-
spire not desire but distrust. People will start to lose interest. Eventually
you may find it worthwhile to commit to one sidevwif only for appearances’
sake, to prove you are capable of attachment.
Even then, however, the key will be to maintain your inner indepen-
dence-—to keep yourself from getting emotionally involved. Preserve the
unspoken option of being able to leave at any moment and reclaim your
freedom if the side you are allied with starts to collapse. The friends you
made while you were being courted will give you plenty of places to go
once you jump ship.
