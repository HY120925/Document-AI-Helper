from Paris to arrest him, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former
leader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volun-
teers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris,
crowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country.
For the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the
giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted,
and there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle of Waterloo,
injune of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies
had learned their lesson: They exiled him to the barren island of Saint I-Ie~
lena, off the west coast of Africa. There he had no more hope of escape.
