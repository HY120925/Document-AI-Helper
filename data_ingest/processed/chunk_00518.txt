JUDGMENT
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies’ to gather
valuable infmrmation that will keep you a step ahead.
Better stz'll: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encoun~
ters, learn to pmbe. Ask indirect questions to get people to
reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occa-
sion that is not an ojiponfunity for artful spying.
