TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
In the mid—ninth century A.l.)., a young man named Michael III assumed
the throne of the Byzantine Empire. His mother, the Empress Theodora,
had been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus, had been mur-
dered; at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora and enthrone
Michael had been Michael’s uncle, Bardas, a man of intelligence and a:mbi~
tion. Michael was now a young, inexperienced ruler, surrounded by in»
triguers, murderers, and profligates. In this time of peril he needed
someone he could trust as his councillor, and his thoughts turned to Basil~
ius, his best friend. Basilius had no experience whatsoever in government
and politics——-in fact, he was the head of the royal stables——buI he had
proven his love and gratitude time and again.
