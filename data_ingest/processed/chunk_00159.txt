all who heard it “Woe unto the statesman,” he said, “who makes war with-
out a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you

praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he
had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against
the wa.r——what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused,
and several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his minis-
ters won out, and war was averted.
