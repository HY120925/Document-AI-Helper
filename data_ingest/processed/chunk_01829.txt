to notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was playing a double game, se-
cretly helping the Athenians in their war with Sparta and thus reingrafiab

few while at the same time alienating many more. The secret to gaining as»
cendancy over large numbers, he came to believe, was not to impose his
colors but to absorb the colors of those around him, like a chameleon.
