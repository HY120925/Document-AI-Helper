in Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their best—known
weakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, “See to it that Aretino is your
friend / For he is a bad enemy to have. I His words alone could ruin the
high pope / So God guard everyone from his tongue.”
Interpretation
With one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a servant
himself, hurled himself to fame. Everyone in Rome rushed to find out who
this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by his audacity, sought
him out and ended up giving him a job in the papal service. Over the years
he came to be known as the “Scourge of Princes,” and his biting tongue
earned him the respect and fear of the great, from the king of France to the
Hapsburg emperor.
