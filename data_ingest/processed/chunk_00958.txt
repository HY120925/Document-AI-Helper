scapegoat’s guilt-—why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were
guilty? And the other couxtiers, resendul of the favorite anyway, would re-
joice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid himself of a man who
by that time had probably learned too much about him, perhaps becoming
arrogant and even disdainful of him. Choosing a close associate as a scape-
goat has the same value as the “fall of the favorite.” You may lose a friend
or aide, but in the long—term scheme of things, it is more important to hide
your mistakes than to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn
against you. Besides, you can always find a. new favorite to take his place.
