Hare. The lion creates no
gaps in his way——his
movements are too
swift, hisjaws too quick
and powerful. The
timid hare will do any-
thing to escape danger,
but in its haste to
retreat and flee, it backs
into traps, hops smack
into its enemies’ jaws.
Authority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than
cautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to
master her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets
herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed
coldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to
the young, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master
her with greater audacity. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)
