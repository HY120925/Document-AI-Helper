Authority: He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a
stale, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of
the old forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no
change in the institutions, even though in fact they are entirely different
from the old ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with ap-
pearances, as though they were realities. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)
