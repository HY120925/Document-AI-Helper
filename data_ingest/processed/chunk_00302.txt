it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing
you could say for sure about her——she was always changing, always sur-
prising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air
of mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering
about her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the
other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good
dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the
public’s attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery.
People are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpreta-
tion, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what
cannot be seized and consumed creates power.
