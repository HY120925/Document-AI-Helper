JUDGMENT
The best deeeptirms are the ones that seem to give the
other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in con-
trol, but are actually your puppets. Give people options
that come out in yourfavor whichever one they choose.
Force them to make choices between the lesser of two evils,
both of which serve your purpose. Put them an the horns
ofa dilemma: They me gmed wherever they turn.
