votion to his first and only mistress.
Interpretation
Diane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background, man-
aged to captivate Henri for over twenty years. By the time he died she was
well into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased with the years.
She knew the king well. He was not an intellectual but a lover of the out-
doors——he particularly loved jousting tournaments, with their bright pen-
nants, brilliantly caparisoned horses, and beautifully dressed women.
Henri’s love of visual splendor seemed childlike to Diane, and she played
on this weakness of his at every opportunity.
