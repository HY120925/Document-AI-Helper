REVERSAL
There can really be no reversal to this critical law: Bad theater is bad the-
ater. Even appearing natural requires a.rt—in other words, acting. Bad act-
ing only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be too
dramatic—avoid the histfionic gesture. But that is simply bad theater any-
way, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against overacting. In
essence there is no reversal to this law.
