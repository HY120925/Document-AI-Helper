and her son; but Richelieu saw that she was really an insecure woman who
needed constant masculine attention. He showered her with afiection and
respect, even toadying up to her favorite, Concini. He knew the day would
come when the king would take over, but he also recognized that Louis

change overnight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his afv
fection would never change.
