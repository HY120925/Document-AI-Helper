GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT
Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own muse. Not only will such assis-
tance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of ejficiertcy and speed. In the end
your hehpers will beforgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.
LAW 8 page 62
MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU—-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY
When you forte the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent
come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him withfabulous gains-then attack. You hold
the cards.
