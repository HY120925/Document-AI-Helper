would laugh hysterically. At the height of the delirium Mesmer would
reenter the salon, dressed in a flowing silk robe embroidered with golden
flowers and carrying a white magnetic rod. Moving around the container,
he would stroke and soothe the patients until calm was restored. Many
women would later attribute the strange power he had on them to his
piercing look, which, they thought, was exciting or quieting the magnetic
fluids in their bodies.
Within months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage. His
supporters included Marie—Antoinette herself, the queen of France, wife of
Louis XVI. As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official faculty of med-
icine, but it did not matter. His growing following of pupils and patients
paid him handsomely.
