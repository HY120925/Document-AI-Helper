LAW I 3 page 95
WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELFAINTEREST,
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE
Ifyou need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him ofyour past assistance and good deeds. He
willfind a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that
will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion, He will respond enthusiastically when he sees some-
thing to be gainedfor himself.
