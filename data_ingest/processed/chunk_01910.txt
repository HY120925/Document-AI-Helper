NEVER APPEAR
TOO PERFECT
JUDGMENT
Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but
must dangerous 0,’ all is to apglear to have no faults or
weaknesses. Em/y creates silent enemies. It is smart to ac-
casionally display defects, and admit to hmmless vices,
in wder to deflect envy and appear more human and ap-
proachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect
with impunity.
