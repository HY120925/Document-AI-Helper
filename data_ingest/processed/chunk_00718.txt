them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen
and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.
Image:
The Virgin Queen.
The center of attention,
desire, and worship. Never
succumbing to one suitor or the
other, the Virgin Queen keeps
them all revolving around
her like planets, unable to
leave her orbit but never
getting any closer
to her.
Authority: Do not commit
yourself to anybody or any
thing, for that is to be a slave, a
slave to every man. . . . Above
all, keep yourself free of com-
mitments and obligations——
they are the device of another
to get you into his power.
