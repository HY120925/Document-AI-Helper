WHEN ASKING FOR HELP,
APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S
SELF-INTEREST,
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY
OR GRATITUDE
JUDGMENT
Ifyou need to cum to an allyfor help, do not bother to re-
mind him of your past assistzmm and goad deeds. He
will find a way to you. Instead, uncover some-
thing in your request, arr in your ailiance with him, that
will lzenqit him, and emphasize it out of all prnportian.
Hz: will mspond enthusiastically when he sees smnetkéng
to be gainedfor himself
