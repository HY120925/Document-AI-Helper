That day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouché, but by then
Napoleon’s cannons were audible in the distance and the king and all the
king’s men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered Paris, Fouché
came out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once again. Napoleon
greeted his former minister of police and gladly restored him to his old
post. During the 100 days that Napoleon remained in power, until Water-
loo, it was essentially Fouché who governed France. Alter Napoleon fell,
Louis XVIII returned to the throne, and like a cat with nine lives, Fouché
stayed on to serve in yet another goVemment—by then his power and in-
fluence had grown so great that not even the king dared challenge him.
