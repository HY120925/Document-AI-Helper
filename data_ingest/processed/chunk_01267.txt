Authority: A lie is an alluremeut, a fabrication, that can be embell-
ished into a fantasy. It can be clothed in the raiments of a mystic
conception‘ Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb.
A lie is more palatable. The most dctested person in the world is
the one who always tells the truth, who never romances. . . .
I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to
tell the truth. {Joseph Weil, a.l:.a. “The Yellow Kid,” l875wl976)
