notorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They
went undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had
gone to all the right schools, and lit the oldvboy network perfectly. Blend~
ing in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the bet-
ter you can conceal your intentions.
Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors,
to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at having to wear
such a bland rnask~—it is often your unreadability that draws people to you
and makes you appear a person of power.

A sheep never marauds,
a sheep never deceives,
a sheep is magnificently
dumb and docile. With a
sheepskin on his back,
a fox can pass right
into the chicken coop.
