Understanding the foolishness of alienating those below him, de Retz did
everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the role of luck
in his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and deferentially, as if
nothing had changed. (In reality, of course, he now had much more power
than before.) He wrote that these wise policies “produced a good effect, by
lessening the envy which was conceived against me, which is the greatest of
all secrets.” Follow de Retz’s example. Subtly emphasize how lucky you
have been, to make your happiness seem more attainable to other people,
and the need for envy less acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty
that people can easily see through. This will only make them more envious.
