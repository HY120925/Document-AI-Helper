deacl viper that you nurse
back to health. Time makes
the venom grow stronger.
Authority: For it must be
noted, that men must either be
caressed or else annihilated;
they will revenge themselves
for small injuries, but cannot
do so for great ones; the injury
therefore that we do to a man
must be such that we need not
fear his vengeance. {Niccolo
Machiavelli, 1469-1527}
