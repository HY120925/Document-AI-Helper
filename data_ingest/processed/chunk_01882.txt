His anger against Cromwell—f1rst for the ill~conceived reforms, now for
saddling him with an unattractive and Protestant wife-—could no longer be
contained. In June of that year, Cromwell was arrested, charged as a Protes-
tant extremist and a heretic, and sent to the Tower. Six weeks later, before a
large and enthusiastic crowd, the public executioner cut off his head.

Thomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up the power and
wealth of the Church and lay the foundation for Protestantism in England.
