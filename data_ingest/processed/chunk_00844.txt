Many today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical curios-
ity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, “as though heaven, the sun, the
elements, and men had changed the order of their motions and power, and
were different from what they were in ancient limes.” There may be no
more Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people who believe the sun re-
volves around them. The royal court may have more or less disappeared,
or at least lost its power, but courts and courtlers still exist because power
still exists. A courtier is rarely asked to fall off a horse anymore, but the
laws that govern court politics are as timeless as the laws of power. There is
much to be leamed, then, from great courtiers past and present.
