OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty—five—yearvold deputy in
the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career. The issues of
the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into
which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful
neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds,
even threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in
line to be P:ussia’s king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament
rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only
ones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his
ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians.
