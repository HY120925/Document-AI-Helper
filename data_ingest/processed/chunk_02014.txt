been trained in warfare, not politics or economics; because they were so
unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life seduced and
overwhelmed them. Spartan governors were sent to rule what had been
Athenian lands; far from home, they succumbed to the worst forms of cor-
ruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid Athenian way of life was
slowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And
Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive
as a cultural and economic center.
Confused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and
weaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important battle
with the city-state of Thebes. Almost overnight, this once mighty nation
collapsed, never to recover.
