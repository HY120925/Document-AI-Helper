JUDGMENT
All greai leaders since Moses have known that a fe(med
enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have
learned this the hard way. ) Ifmze ember is kgfi alight, no
matter how dimly it smotders, afim will eventually break
out. More is £05: timmgh stopping hagfway than through
mtal annihilation: The enemy will recover; and will seek
revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spiiit.
