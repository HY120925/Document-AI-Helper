KEYS T0 POWER
In the realm of power you must learn to judge your moves by their long»
term effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or
gain a. victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain
how it affects the people you’re arguing with: They may appear to agree
with you politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something
you said inadvertently even offended thern—-words have that insidious
ability to be interpreted according to the other person’s mood and insecuri-
ties. Even the best argument has no solid foundation, for we have all come
to distrust the slippery nature of words. And days after agreeing with some
one, we ofien revert to our old opinion out of sheer habit.
