he would use his vast wealth to soften the soil. First he would ignore his vic-
tim, making the man anxious. Then the man would suddenly find that his
son had been given a well»paid post, or that funds had been spent liberally
in his home region, or that he had been given a painting he had long cov-
eted. Presents would flow from Louis’s hands. Finally, weeks or months
later, Louis would ask for the favor he had needed all along. A man who
had once vowed to do anything to stop the king would find he had lost the
desire to fight. A straightforward bribe would have made him rebellious;
this was far more insidious. Facing hardened earth in which nothing could
take root, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds.
