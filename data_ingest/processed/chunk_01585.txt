Transgression I
After Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, in 1532, gold from the Incan Em-
pire began to pour into Spain, and Spaniards of all classes started dreaming
of the instant riches to be had in the New World. The story soon spread of
an Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each year would ritually cover
himself in gold dust and dive into a lake. Soon word of mouth transformed
El Damrio, the “Golden Man,” into an empire called El Dorado, wealthier
than the Incan, where the streets were paved and the buildings inlaid with
gold. This elaboration of the story did not seem implausible, for surely a
chief who could afiord to waste gold dust in a lake must rule a golden em-
pire. Soon Spaniards were searching for El Dorado all over northern South
America.
