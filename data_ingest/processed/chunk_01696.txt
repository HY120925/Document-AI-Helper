name for himself where no shadows could obscure his presence.
When the painter Diego de Velazquez began his career, he knew he
could not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance
painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that
by the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had
never been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were mem-
bers of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with
the past; the newness of Velé.zquez’s style thrilled them. Most people are
afraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who
can break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there
is so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids.
