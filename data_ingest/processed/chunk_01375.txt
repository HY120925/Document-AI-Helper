MASTER THE ART
OF TIMING
‘JUDGMENT
Never seem to be in a hurrjv——h'wr1ying betrays a lack of
control aver yourselfi and over time. Always seem fra-
tient, as 2]" you know that everything will come to you
eventually. Become a detective of the right moment; snijj’
out the spirit cflhe limes, tke tmnak that will sang; you to
power. Leam to stand back when the time is not yet ripe,
and to smkefiercely when it has reachedfmition.
