enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no
Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan’s practical
joke beforehand, “But since it should always be one’s aim to conform to
the wishes of one’s host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the
success of the meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequiousness, but there
is no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another.”
Hechigwan’s vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch
had pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own
in complying with his host’s wish and watching him amuse himself in
this way.
Interpretation
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer~—-he watched those around him
