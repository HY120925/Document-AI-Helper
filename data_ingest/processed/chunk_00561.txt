KEYS TO POWER
It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China:
Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and
returned to haunt the lenient. “Crush the enemy” is a key strategic tenet of
Surrtzu, the fourth—century—B.C. author of The Art ofl/Wzr. The idea is simple:
Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to elimi-
nate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three
quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make
them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take re-
venge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because
you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.
