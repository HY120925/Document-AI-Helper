This is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your oppo~
nents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate and com
trol. So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to act before
they are ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is to play on un-
controllable emotions—-pride, vanity, love, hate. Once the water is stirred
up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The angrier they become,
the less control they have, and finally they are caught in the whirlpool you
have made, and they drown.
