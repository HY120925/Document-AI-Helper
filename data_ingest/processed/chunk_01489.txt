Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words “the Sun
King”). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract
(such as the image “Diana” standing for chastity). The abstract concept-
purity, patriotism, courage, lovc~—~is full of emotional and powerful associa-
tions. The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of
meanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as
explained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is
that its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his sub-
jects, distinguished him from all other kings, and conjured up a kind of
majesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains
untold power.
