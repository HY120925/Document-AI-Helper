Interpretation
Kenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental illness, but
what joe Orton’s diaries revealed to him was the truth: It was envy, pure
and simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The diaries, which Halli-
well read on the sly, recounted the couple’s days as equals and their strug-
gle for recognition. After Orton found success, the diaries began to
describe Halliwell’s brooding, his rude comments at parties, his growing
sense of inferiority. All of this Orton narrated with a distance that bordered
on contempt.
The diaries made clear Halliwe1l’s bitterness over Orton’s success.
