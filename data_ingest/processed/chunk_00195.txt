hurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had .armed his own
troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had surrounded Balcha’s army
and proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re»
fused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha’s entire force had
been disarmed and scattered in all directions.
Realizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 sol-
diers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked
his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selassie had set
a large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha’s
moves, and had checkmatecl him. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur-
rendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a
monastery.
