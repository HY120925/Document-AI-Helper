Napoleon exploded, “You are a traitor, Fouché! I ought to have you
hanged.” He continued to harangue Fouché, but could not fire him without
proof. Fouché only expressed amazement at the emperor’s words, but in-
wardly he smiled, for all along he had been playing a mirroring game.
Interpretation
Fouché had known for years that Napoleon kept on top of those around
him by spying on them day and night. The minister had survived this game
by having his own spies spy on Napoleon’s spies, thus neutralizing any ac-
tion Napoleon might take against him. In the case of the meeting in Basel,
he even turned the tables: Knowing about Napoleorfs double agent, he set
it up so that it would appear as if Fouché were a loyal double agent too.
