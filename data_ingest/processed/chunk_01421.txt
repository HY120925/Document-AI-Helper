DISDAIN THINGS
YOU CANNOT HAVE:
IGNORING THEM IS
THE BEST REVENGE
_]UDGMEN'I‘
By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence
and credibility. The meme altentirm you pay an enemy,
the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often
made worse and more visible when you try tofiic it. It is
sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something
you want but cannot have, show mntemptfai it. The less
interest you reveal, the more supenbryou seem.
