around the papers broke and the documents scattered on the ground. It
took them many minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time
they had reached the city gates, it was too late.
When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest
of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if
you had taken your time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but
papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in con-
stant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created.
Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is your best move»-you wait,
you deliberately slow down. As time passes it will eventually present op
portunities you had not imagined.
