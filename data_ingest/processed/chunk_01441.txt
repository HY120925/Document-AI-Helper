he insisted that his marriage to Catherine had been dissolved, and in 1533
he married Anne Boleyn.
Clement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not care.
He no longer recognized the pope‘s authority, and proceeded to break
with the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England in
its stead, with the king as the head of the new church. And so, not surpris-
ingly, the newly formed Church of England proclaimed Anne Boleyn Eng-
land’s rightful queen.
The pope tried every threat in the book, but nothing worked. Henry
simply ignored him. Clement fumed—no one had ever treated him so con-
temptuously. Henry had humiliated him and he had no power of recourse.
Even excommunication (which he constantly threatened but never camed
out) would no longer matter.
