Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, As the weeks of the cam-
paign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah
Valley, then back to it.
His movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend
Richmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan’s ab-
sence had left it unprotected? Was be heading north to wreak havoc up
there? Why was his small force moving in circles?
Jacksorfs inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the
march on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Mean-
while, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle
that could have crushed the Confederacy turned into a stalemate. Jackson
used this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces.
