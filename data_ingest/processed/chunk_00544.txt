adviser, Fan Tseng, who warned him, “This village headman [Liu Fang]
used to be greedy only for riches and women, but since entering the capital
he has not been led astray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming
high.”
Fan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his rival before it was too late. He told
the general to invite the wily peasant to a banquet at their camp outside
Hsien-yang, and, in the midst of a celebratory sword dance, to have his
head out off. The invitation was sent; Liu fell for the trap, and came to the
banquet. But I-Isiang hesitated in ordering the sword dance, and by the
time he gave the signal, Liu had sensed a trap, and managed to escape.
“Bah!” cried Fan Tseng in disgust, seeing that Hsiang had botched the plot.
