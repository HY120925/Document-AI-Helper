Anet overwhelmed Henri, who soon was trumpeting the image of
Diane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple appeared
together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople welcomed them
with a tableau vimznt depicting a scene with Diana the huntress. France’s
greatest poet of the period, Pierre de Ronsard, began to write verses in
honor of Diana—indeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang up, all inspired by
the king’s mistress. It seemed to Henri that Diane had given herself a kind
of divine aura, and as if he were destined to worship her for the rest of his
life. And until his death, in 1559, he did remain faithful to her—making her
a duchess, giving her untold wealth, and displaying an almost religious do
votion to his first and only mistress.
