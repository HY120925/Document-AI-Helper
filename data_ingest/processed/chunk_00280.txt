months the crowds began to dwindle, so Barnum sent an anonymous letter
to the papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud. ‘joice Heath,” he
wrote, “is not a human being but an automaton, made up of whalebone,
indie-rubber, and numberless springs.” Those who had not bothered to see
her before were immediately curious, and those who had already seen her
paid to see her again, to find out whether the rumor that she was a robot
was true.
In 1842, Barnum purchased the carcass of what was purported to be a
mermaid. This creature resembled a monkey with the body of a fish, but
the head and body were perfectly joined—it was truly a wonder. After
some research Barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put
together injapan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir.
