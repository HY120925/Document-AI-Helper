made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more
charmed by the finance minister than by the king himself, and that Fouquet
was actually flauming his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis
XXV, Fouquet’s elaborate party offended the king’s vanity. Louis would not
admit this to anyone, of course-—-instead, he found a convenient excuse to
rid himself of a man who had inadvertently made him feel insecure.
Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the
master’s sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make him doubt his pro
eminence.
When the wming began, Fouquet was at the to}: of the world.
By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom.
