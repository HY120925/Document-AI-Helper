KNOW WHO YOU’RE
DEALING WITH-
DO NOT OFFEND THE
WRONG PERSON
JUDGMENT
There are many different kinds of people in the world,
and you can never assume that everyone will react to
your strategies in the same way. Deeeive or outmaneuver
some [maple and they will spend the rest oftheir lives seek-
ing revenge. They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose
your victims and opponents carefully, then-—never of-
fend or deceive the wrong person.
