No matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid him
with gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and depen-
dence. There must be an easier way, he thought.
Galileo hit on a new strategy in l6l0, when he discovered the moons
of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons—giving
one the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on—as
he had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He
chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established
the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the
gods, the Medici symbol—a symbol of a. power that went beyond politics
and banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities.
