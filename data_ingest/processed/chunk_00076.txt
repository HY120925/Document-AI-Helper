parate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common
threads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to
be fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu-
mulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate
gists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers
(Castiglione, Gracién), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con
artists (“Yellow Kid” Weil) in history.
The laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always in-
crease one’s power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it
and even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and
observances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless
and definitive.
