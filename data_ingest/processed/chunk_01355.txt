which he had insisted. The only one she denied——and only in the contract’s
fine print—was the 10 percent of all revenues from any lands discovered:
an absurd demand, since he wanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause
been left in, it would eventually have made Columbus and his heirs the
wealthiest family on the planet. Columbus never read the fine print.)
Satisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail that same
year in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was careful to hire
the best navigator he could find to help him get there.) The mission failed
to find such a passage, yet when Columbus petitioned the queen to finance
an even more ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then
she had come to see Columbus as destined for great things.
