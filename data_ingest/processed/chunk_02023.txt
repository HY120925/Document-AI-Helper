spread through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists
away. Once Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse.
In 1945 and ’46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily
took the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this
critical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When the Na-
tionalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to Manchuria’s most
out-of—the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist armies,
ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed
units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a
town only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards I101’
vanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive
and formless.
