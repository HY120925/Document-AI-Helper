around without mercy.
Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority. The bold move makes
you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly,
with the stealth and swiftness of a snake, it inspires that much more fear. By
intimidating with a bold move, you establish a precedent: in every subse-
quent encounter, people will be on the defensive, in terror of your next
strike.
Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you
enter an action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your
own path. When a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options
where there are none and inadvertently creating more problems still. Re-
treating from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares.
