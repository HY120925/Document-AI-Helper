before they unconsciously push you away. It is a game of hide—and~seek.
The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love
and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the 1over‘s absence stim-
ulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around him or her. But this
aura fades when you know too much--~when your imagination no longer
has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a
person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth-
century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with
drawal from one’s lover. “Love never dies of starvation,” she wrote, “but
often of indigestion.”
